        <h3>Course Overview</h3>
        <p class="p1">Neural networks have increasingly taken over various AI tasks, and currently produce the state of the art in many AI tasks ranging from computer vision and planning for self-driving cars to playing computer games. Basic knowledge of NNs, known currently in the popular literature as "deep learning", familiarity with various formalisms, and knowledge of tools, is now an essential requirement for any researcher or developer in most AI and NLP fields. 

This course is a broad introduction to the field of neural networks and their "deep" learning formalisms. The course traces some of the development of neural network theory and design through time, leading quickly to a discussion of various network formalisms, including simple feedforward, convolutional, recurrent, and probabilistic formalisms, the rationale behind their development, and challenges behind learning such networks and various proposed solutions. We subsequently cover various extensions and models that enable their application to various tasks such as computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation and playing games. 


</p>

        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
        <p>This course is intended for graduate students and qualified undergraduate students with a strong mathematical and programming background. Undergraduate level training or coursework in algorithms, linear
        algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics is suggested. A background in programming will also be necessary for the problem sets; students are expected to be familiar with python or learn it during the course. </p>
    
        <h3>Textbooks</h3>
        There will be no required textbooks, though we suggest the
        following to help you to study (all available online):
        <ul>
          <li> An online textbook: https://www.deeplearningbook.org/ 
        </ul>
        We will provide suggested readings from these books in the schedule 
        below.

        <h3>Piazza</h3>
        <p> We will use Piazza for class discussions. Please go to the course Piazza site to join the course forum (note: you must use a cmu.edu email account to join the forum). We strongly encourage students to post on this forum rather than emailing the course staff directly (this will be more efficient for both students and staff). Students should use Piazza to: 
        <ul>
          <li>Ask clarifying questions about the course material.</li>
          <li>Share useful resources with classmates (so long as they do not
          contain homework solutions).</li>
          <li>Look for students to form study groups.</li>
          <li>Answer questions posted by other students to solidify your own
          understanding of the material.</li>
        </ul>
        The course Academic Integrity Policy must be followed on the message boards at all times. <b>Do not post or request homework solutions!</b> Also, please be polite.
        
        <h3>Grading Policy</h3>
        <p> The grading policy will depend on what class you are signed up for.: 
        <ul>
          <li> <b>18-786 </b>
          <ul>
            <li>5 Homeworks (60%)</li>
            <li>Final Project (40%)</li>
          </ul>
         <li> <b>18-780 </b>
           <ul>
             <li>4 Homeworks (100%)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Gradescope:</b> We will use Gradescope to collect PDF submissions of each problem set. Upon uploading your PDF, Gradescope will ask you to identify which page(s) contains your solution for each problem – this is a great way to double check that you haven’t left anything out. The course staff will manually grade your submission, and you’ll receive feedback explaining your final marks.<p>
        <b>Regrade Requests:</b> If you believe an error was made during grading, you’ll be able to submit a regrade request on Gradescope. <i>For each homework, regrade requests will be open for only 1 week after the grades have been published.</i> This is to encourage you to check the feedback you’ve received early!

        <p>
          <b>Late submissions will not be accepted</b>.   
          <i>There is one exception to this rule</i>: You are given 6 “late days” (self-granted 24-hr extensions) which you can use to give yourself extra time without penalty. <b>At most two late days can be used per assignment, except for final report, which no late days are allowed.</b> This will be monitored automatically via Gradescope.</li>               
        </p>

        <!-- <h3>Grading Policy</h3>
        <p> Grades will be based on the following components: 
        <ul>
          <li> <b>Problem Sets (50%) </b>
          <ul>
            <li> Solutions will be graded on both correctness and clarity. If
            you cannot solve a problem completely, you will get more partial
            credit by identifying the gaps in your argument than by 
            attempting to cover them up. 
          </ul>
          <li> <b>Midterm (20%), Final (30%)</b>: These exams will cover material
          from the lectures and the problem sets.
          <li> <b>Bonus</b>: On Piazza, the top student “endorsed answer” answerers can earn bonus points.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Gradescope:</b> We will use Gradescope to collect PDF submissions of each problem set. Upon uploading your PDF, Gradescope will ask you to identify which page(s) contains your solution for each problem – this is a great way to double check that you haven’t left anything out. The course staff will manually grade your submission, and you’ll receive feedback explaining your final marks.<p/>

        <b>Regrade Requests:</b> If you believe an error was made during grading, you’ll be able to submit a regrade request on Gradescope. <i>For each homework, regrade requests will be open for only 1 week after the grades have been published.</i> This is to encourage you to check the feedback you’ve received early! -->

        <h3>Academic Integrity Policy</h3>
        Group studying and collaborating on problem sets are encouraged, as
        working together is a great way to understand new material.  Students
        are free to discuss the homework problems with anyone under the
        following conditions:
        <ul>
          <li>Students must write their own solutions and understand the
          solutions that they wrote down.</li>
          <li>Students must list the names of their collaborators (i.e., anyone
          with whom the assignment was discussed).</li>
          <li>Students may not use old solution sets from other classes under any circumstances, unless the instructor grants
          special permission.</li>
        </ul>
        
        Students are encouraged to read CMU's <a
          href=https://www.cmu.edu/policies/
          target="_blank"> Policy on Cheating and Plagiarism</a>.

        <h3>Using LaTeX</h3>
        <p> Students are strongly encouraged to use LaTeX for problem sets.  LaTeX makes it
        simple to typeset mathematical equations, and is extremely useful for
        graduate students to know. Most of the academic papers you read were
        written with LaTeX, and probably most of the textbooks too. <a
          href=http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf
          target="_blank">Here</a> is an excellent LaTeX tutorial and <a
          href=http://latex-project.org/ftp.html target="_blank">here</a> are
        instructions for installing LaTeX on your machine.
        </p>
